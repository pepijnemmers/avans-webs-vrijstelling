# Responsive Website — HTML & CSS Exemption Project  
**Avans Hogeschool – Bachelor Year 1**  
**Assignment: HTML/CSS Fundamentals**

---

## 🌐 Project Overview  
This project was created as part of an exemption assignment during the first year of the bachelor’s program at Avans University of Applied Sciences.  
Due to prior experience, I completed this project independently to demonstrate proficiency in responsive web design using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without any JavaScript.

The assignment required building a fully responsive multi-page website, consisting of:

- A well-structured **homepage**  
- A **gallery or overview page**  
- A **form page** (e.g., contact or signup form)

## 🧩 Assignment Goal  
The goal of this exemption assignment was to show mastery of:

- Semantic HTML structure  
- Responsive layouts using CSS media queries and flexible units  
- Form design using only native HTML/CSS  
- Clean and accessible design, fully functional across devices

After submission, the project was reviewed and approved — resulting in **official exemption** from the standard HTML/CSS module.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** — Structure and content  
- **CSS3** — Layout and responsive styling
